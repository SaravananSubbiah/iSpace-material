          "text": "What is a smart city? Typically a smart city is one where resources are used in a smart way to increase efficiency and improve daily life of the citizens living in that city. So, as an example think of :\na. using your cell phone to switch on and off lights in your house, \nb. or locking your bike if you forget to lock it in the parking lot, \nc. monitor and water your plants, and so on. \nAll these tasks ensure that resources are used efficiently when needed and not used when not necessary. In this semester you will build a smart city by installing \nsmart parking lots\nsmart farms\nsmart inventory systems\nsmart parks\nsmart Traffic lights\netc. Each one of these installations require skills from multiple disciplines such as math, science, programming and above all analytical and critical thinking. We hope that you will enjoy this activity, learn new technologies and skills and have fun completing the activities."

Such a system lets the driver know were he or she may find a spot to park without having to search for open slots. Use of cameras in parking lots can also capture information about cars parked and in case of criminal activities detect the owner of the car using the camera feed. \n\nAdditionally, since this information can be connected to the Internet, the owner will also be able to know which time slots tend to be busy and require more monitoring. \n\nUpon completing this project the student will be able to\nDescribe what a smart parking lot is\nIdentify the significant components required to design a smart parking lot\nAnalyze requirements to construct each component of the smart parking lot\nImplement the requirements and build the smart parking lot"
